### Problem Description:

Write a SQL query that retrieves the following information about employees:

1. **Employee ID**
2. **"F and L" Column**:
   * This column should contain the 3rd character of the employee’s first name followed by an apostrophe (`'`), and then the employee’s last name.
   * If the first name has fewer than 3 characters, only the full first name followed by the apostrophe should be used.
3. **Department Name or Manager's Name**:
   * If the employee does not belong to any department (i.e., department name is `NULL`), display:
     * The 2nd character (in uppercase) of the employee's manager’s first name (if available).
     * If the manager’s first name is unavailable, display the employee’s first name in uppercase.
   * Otherwise, display the department name.
4. **"Manager's Info"**:
   * If the employee’s manager’s last name is available, display the second-to-last character of the manager’s last name.
   * If not, display the employee’s ID.
5. **Salary**:
   * Display the employee’s salary in the format `$12,000.00`, ensuring there are no extra spaces, and that two decimal points are always shown.
6. **Manager's Manager Name**:
   * If the employee’s manager has a manager, display the first name of the manager's manager.
7. **Manager's Manager's Salary**:
   * If the manager’s manager's salary is available, display it.
   * If the manager’s manager’s salary is not available, display the employee's first name.

### Conditions:

The query should only return information about employees that satisfy the following conditions:

* The employee's manager’s manager either:
  * **Is not defined** (i.e., has no manager).
  * **Has a name with an odd number of characters**.
* The manager’s salary must be **at least 1.5 times less** than their own manager's manager's salary, or neither the manager nor the manager’s manager is defined.

### Sorting:

* First, order the employees based on their hire date:
  * Employees hired in the second half of the month (on or after the 16th day) should come first.
* Then, order by whether the employee's first name has an **odd** or **even** number of characters:
  * Employees with **odd**-character first names should come first.

### Provided Solution Explanation:

The given SQL query implements the solution as described above. It makes use of `CASE` statements to handle various conditions for string manipulation and checks for the existence of managers and manager's managers. The `LEFT JOIN` is used to retrieve information about the department, manager, and manager’s manager, ensuring that missing values are handled properly. The final sorting is done based on the hire date and the length of the employee's first name.
