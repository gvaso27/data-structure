# Library Database Schema and Queries

### Problem Description:

Create a relational database structure for the "Our Shelf" library.

The client's minimum requirements are as follows:

- It should track the total number of books, the number of available books, and the number of issued books at any given time.
- It should display the number of available and issued books by genre.
- It should display the most and least read books by genre.
- It should display who has borrowed a book, their contact information, the issue date, and the return date.
- It should display the list of users who have not returned books on time and how many days they are overdue.
- It should list the books that are overdue and calculate the fine (there is a fine per overdue day, which varies by genre).
- It should track books that are close to expiring (1 month or less).
- It should track damaged books.

You are required to create the tables, constraints, and provide the SQL queries that meet these requirements.
