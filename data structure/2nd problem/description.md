### Problem Description:

You are tasked with retrieving grouped information from the **`jobs`** table, where each **`job_id`** represents an employeeâ€™s position (e.g., `IT_PROG`, `PUB_CLERK`, `DEV_TEST`, `MK_MAN`, `MK_REP`, etc.). For each **job prefix**, you need to extract and display the following:

1. **Job Prefix (Pref)**:
   * The **prefix** is derived from the `job_id`, which is the substring before the first underscore (`_`). For example, from `IT_PROG`, the prefix is `IT`.
2. **Distinct Job Positions**:
   * The count of **distinct job titles** that share the same prefix (e.g., `MK_MAN` and `MK_REP` have the prefix `MK`, but represent 2 different job titles).
3. **Employees Count**:
   * The number of **employees** working in job positions that start with that prefix.
   * If no employees work in that position, display: `'No Emp ON X'`, where `X` is the prefix.
4. **Employees with 'a' in Their First Name**:
   * The count of employees under that prefix whose first name contains the letter `'a'` (case insensitive).
5. **Employees Hired in 2002**:
   * The count of employees under that prefix who were **hired in the year 2002**.
6. **Average Salary**:
   * The **average salary** of employees under that prefix, **rounded to the nearest hundred**.

### Sorting:

* First, display the information for the prefix **IT**.
* Next, display the information for the prefix **MK**.
* Finally, display all other prefixes sorted in **descending order of average salary**. If the average salary is `NULL`, display those prefixes last.

The SQL query provided successfully implements this solution by:

* Using **string functions** to extract job prefixes.
* **LEFT JOIN** to link employees to their jobs.
* Applying **grouping and aggregation** functions for counting, summing, and calculating averages.
* Handling cases where no employees exist using `CASE` statements.
* Sorting based on specific requirements.
